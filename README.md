# Antares

**A simulator calibrated to *this* robot, from its own logs.**

Every physical robot is a slightly different deploy target: servo gains
drift, joints wear, calibrations differ. A policy that works in a generic
sim meets a specific arm in the real world. Antares takes a few minutes of
one robot's recorded episodes, fits the simulator to that unit, and shows
you how much of the sim-to-real gap closed.

## How it works

1. **Load real logs.** Commanded actions and measured joint positions
   from a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset (no
   video needed).
2. **Replay in sim.** Start MuJoCo from the real initial state, feed the
   same commands, and measure where the sim drifts from reality.
3. **Calibrate.** CMA-ES fits actuator gain, damping, armature, friction,
   and latency to that robot's episodes, scored on held-out ones.
4. **See it.** The web UI overlays the real arm and the sim ghost in 3D
   and streams the fit live, so you watch the ghost lock on.

First embodiment: the SO-100/101 arm, using public community datasets.

## Run it

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/antares serve            # API on :8000

cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # UI on :5173
```

Or build the UI once (`cd web && npm run build`) and `antares serve` alone
serves it on :8000.

In the viewer, the white arm is the logged robot and the blue ghost is the
simulator replaying the same commands. Pick an episode, scrub the timeline,
switch the ghost between the default sim and a saved lock, or press
**Calibrate** to fit a new lock and watch the ghost lock on as the error
drops.

Inspect a dataset from the CLI:

```sh
.venv/bin/antares inspect lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace
```

### Export

A calibration is saved as a lock (`locks/<name>.lock.json`). Export one as
a standalone MJCF to use it in any MuJoCo / RL pipeline without Antares:

```sh
.venv/bin/antares locks                               # list saved locks
.venv/bin/antares export svla_so101_pickplace         # -> export/svla_so101_pickplace/
.venv/bin/antares export svla_so101_pickplace -o out/ --no-bundle   # meshdir -> package assets
python -m mujoco.viewer --mjcf export/svla_so101_pickplace/scene.xml
```

The output directory holds:

| File | What |
|---|---|
| `<name>.xml` | the SO-101 MJCF with the fitted `kp`/`kv`, `damping`/`armature`/`frictionloss` baked into the `sts3215` class, plus a header comment with the lock's provenance and held-out scores |
| `<name>.antares.json` | sidecar: all params including `latency_frames` (MJCF cannot express command latency; delay each `ctrl` by this many dataset frames in your control loop), the dataset-unit -> radian map, scores |
| `scene.xml` | the arm plus floor and light, for the viewer |
| `assets/*.stl` | the meshes (omitted with `--no-bundle`, which points `meshdir` at the package's copy) |

The same files come from the API: `GET /api/locks/<name>/export` is the XML
as a download and `GET /api/locks/<name>/export.zip` is a zip of the whole
directory. From Python, `antares.export.export_mjcf(lock, path)` /
`export_scene(lock, dir)`; `load_exported_arm(path)` builds an `Arm` from
an export, and its replay matches `Arm(params=lock.params)` to 1e-9.

## Drift over a session

Episodes are recorded in order, so a servo that heats up or a joint that
wears during the session should show up as parameters that stop fitting.
`antares drift` slides a window over the episodes, refits the sim on each
window warm-started from a saved lock (small CMA-ES step, 60 evaluations,
a few seconds per window) and records, per window, the fitted parameters,
their training error and the error of the lock's static parameters on the
same episodes:

```sh
.venv/bin/antares drift lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace --lock svla_so101_pickplace \
    --window 10 --step 5
```

Each parameter and both scores get a least-squares slope against episode
index (log10 space for the log-scaled parameters), an r², and a 95%
bootstrap interval over windows. A quantity is flagged as drifting only if
the interval excludes zero *and* the fitted line moves more than 10% from
the first window to the last. The scan is saved next to the lock as
`locks/<name>.drift.json`; the API exposes it as `POST /api/drift` (a job
streamed over `/api/jobs/{id}/events`, one event per window) and
`GET /api/drift/{name}`.

What the two demo datasets show (window 10, step 5, nine windows each):

* **SO-100**: the lock's error grows from 0.71° to about 0.83° over the
  session (+16%, r² 0.65, significant). The refits do not recover it
  (they beat the lock by under 3% on any window) and no parameter moves
  consistently, so this is a harder tail of the session, not wear the
  six parameters can describe. Most of the growth is in `elbow_flex`
  (1.11° to 1.32°) and `shoulder_lift`.
* **SO-101**: the lock's error is flat (1.04° to 1.14°, +5%). The scan
  flags `armature` (+269%), but with r² 0.36, a 4% mean refit gain and two
  windows where the refit found nothing better than the lock itself, that
  is scatter in a weakly constrained parameter rather than drift. The
  verdict says so.

Overlapping windows are not independent, so the bootstrap interval is
optimistic; treat a flag as "worth a look", not as a measurement of wear.

## Status

Weekend hackathon project. Data loading, replay, calibration, robot locks
and the web viewer work end to end on the SO-101 and SO-100 demo datasets.
