# Antares

**A simulator calibrated to *this* robot, from its own logs.**

Every physical robot is a slightly different deploy target: servo gains
drift, joints wear, calibrations differ. A policy that works in a generic
sim meets a specific arm in the real world. Antares takes a few minutes of
one robot's recorded episodes, fits the simulator to that unit, and shows
you how much of the sim-to-real gap closed.

## How it works

1. **Load real logs.** Commanded actions and measured joint positions
   from a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset (no
   video needed).
2. **Replay in sim.** Start MuJoCo from the real initial state, feed the
   same commands, and measure where the sim drifts from reality.
3. **Calibrate.** CMA-ES fits actuator gain, damping, armature, friction,
   and latency to that robot's episodes, scored on held-out ones.
4. **See it.** The web UI overlays the real arm and the sim ghost in 3D
   and streams the fit live, so you watch the ghost lock on.

First embodiment: the SO-100/101 arm, using public community datasets.

## Run it

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/antares serve            # API on :8000

cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # UI on :5173
```

Inspect a dataset from the CLI:

```sh
.venv/bin/antares inspect lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace
```

## Gate deploys on your robot's drift

A lock is a snapshot of how one arm behaved on the day it was calibrated.
Servos wear, belts loosen, someone recalibrates: the arm stops matching its
sim, and a policy that passed in sim meets a different robot. `antares
check` is the test suite for that. Record a few fresh episodes, replay them
through the locked sim, and fail if the tracking error has grown past
`max(--threshold, --ratio * <the lock's held-out score>)`:

```sh
# fresh logs from the Hub, or a LeRobot dataset directory you just recorded
.venv/bin/antares check lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace --lock svla_so101_pickplace
.venv/bin/antares check ./recordings/2026-10-17 --lock my_arm --last 10 --threshold 2
```

```
joint          rmse (deg)  reference  limit  status
-------------  ----------  ---------  -----  -----------------
shoulder_pan   0.405       0.349      0.524  PASS  <- worst
shoulder_lift  0.854       0.968      1.452  PASS

overall        1.067       1.054      1.582  PASS
OK: lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace vs lock svla_so101_pickplace: 1.067 deg RMSE on 10 episodes (reference 1.054, limit 1.582)
```

Exit codes: `0` pass, `1` drifted, `2` usage error or too few episodes
(`--min-episodes`, default 5). `--json` prints the full `CheckResult`. The
same check is `POST /api/check` with
`{"dataset", "lock", "threshold_deg"?, "ratio"?, "last"?}`.

In CI, the repo is a composite GitHub Action. Point it at your dataset and
lock and the job fails when the robot drifts:

```yaml
- uses: actions/checkout@v4
- uses: your-org/antares@main
  with:
    dataset: your-org/so101_arm_a_daily   # or a directory in the workspace
    lock: so101_arm_a                     # locks/so101_arm_a.lock.json
    threshold: "2"                        # optional, degrees
    last: "10"                            # optional, newest N episodes
```

`.github/workflows/robot-check.yml` is a working example (manual and
weekly) against the public SO-101 dataset and the lock under `locks/`. The
tests in `tests/test_check.py` prove the gate bites: real episodes pass,
the same episodes with 3 frames of extra lag or excursions scaled to 0.9
(a weak servo) fail.

## Status

Weekend hackathon project. Data loading and the UI shell work; replay
and calibration are in progress.
