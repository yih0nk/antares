# Antares

**A simulator calibrated to *this* robot, from its own logs.**

Every physical robot is a slightly different deploy target: servo gains
drift, joints wear, calibrations differ. A policy that works in a generic
sim meets a specific arm in the real world. Antares takes a few minutes of
one robot's recorded episodes, fits the simulator to that unit, and shows
you how much of the sim-to-real gap closed.

## How it works

1. **Load real logs.** Commanded actions and measured joint positions
   from a [LeRobot](https://github.com/huggingface/lerobot) dataset (no
   video needed).
2. **Replay in sim.** Start MuJoCo from the real initial state, feed the
   same commands, and measure where the sim drifts from reality.
3. **Calibrate.** CMA-ES fits actuator gain, damping, armature, friction,
   and latency to that robot's episodes, scored on held-out ones.
4. **See it.** The web UI overlays the real arm and the sim ghost in 3D
   and streams the fit live, so you watch the ghost lock on.

First embodiment: the SO-100/101 arm, using public community datasets.

## Run it

```sh
python3.11 -m venv .venv && .venv/bin/pip install -e ".[dev]"
.venv/bin/antares serve            # API on :8000

cd web && npm install && npm run dev   # UI on :5173
```

Inspect a dataset from the CLI:

```sh
.venv/bin/antares inspect lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace
```

## Domain randomization from data

Policies are usually trained with simulator parameters randomized inside
hand-picked ranges ("friction +-30%"). A lock lets you measure the ranges
instead: refit the sim on several random subsets of the robot's episodes,
each warm-started from the lock with a small CMA-ES step, and read how far
the fitted parameters scatter. That scatter is what the data leaves
undetermined, and so what a policy for this arm should be robust to.

```sh
.venv/bin/antares dr lerobot/svla_so101_pickplace        # ~30 s, 8 refits
```

For the SO-101 lock (8 refits x 12 episodes x 60 evaluations; `lo`/`hi`
are the 5th/95th percentiles of the fitted values in log space, widened to
contain the lock value; latency is the integer min/max):

| param | nominal | lo | hi | spread |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| kp | 93.7 | 50.1 | 108.9 | -46% .. +16% |
| kv | 1.57 | 0.62 | 5.07 | -61% .. +223% |
| damping | 0.053 | 0.017 | 0.271 | -68% .. +414% |
| armature | 0.0197 | 0.0018 | 0.031 | -91% .. +56% |
| frictionloss | 0.025 | 0.0028 | 0.108 | -89% .. +328% |
| latency_frames | 4 | 3 | 4 | -1 .. +0 frames |

The ranges are saved as `locks/<name>.dr.json` with their provenance
(dataset, lock, episode subsets, per-fit scores, seed). Use them in a
training loop with `antares.dr.sample` and `apply`; see
`examples/randomize_env.py`.

Does the derived range beat a hand-picked one? Tracking RMSE on the lock's
10 held-out episodes, averaging over 64 parameter sets sampled from each
range (MJCF defaults score 6.01 deg):

| parameters | mean | median | min .. max |
|---|---|---|---|
| (a) lock nominal | 1.05 | | |
| (b) data-derived ranges | 1.39 | 1.20 | 0.97 .. 3.29 |
| (c) hand-picked +-30% | 1.53 | 1.69 | 1.04 .. 2.10 |
| (c') +-30%, latency fixed at nominal | 1.07 | 1.07 | 1.04 .. 1.13 |

The hand-picked range is wrong in both directions at once. On latency,
+-30% around 4 frames allows 5, which the data never supports and which
alone costs about half a degree on average (c vs c'). On the continuous parameters
it is far too narrow: within +-30% the sim is nearly indistinguishable from
nominal (c'), so a policy trained there sees no diversity. The
data-derived ranges span 2-5x on `kv`, `damping` and `frictionloss`, keep
latency where the data puts it, and still average 1.39 deg, 4.3x better
than the uncalibrated sim. Some samples beat the lock itself (min 0.97),
because the lock was fit on different episodes.

Caveat worth knowing: most refits push `kp` to 50, the lower edge of the
search space, so `kp.lo` is set by the bound, not the data. The replay
cannot separate a low gain from a low velocity gain over these episodes.

API: `POST /api/dr {dataset, lock?, n_fits?, n_train?, max_evaluations?,
seed?, name?}` starts a job and returns `{job_id, status_url, events_url}`;
the job streams `progress`, `fit` and `done` events at
`/api/jobs/{id}/events` like calibration does. `GET /api/dr` lists saved
ranges, `GET /api/dr/{name}` returns one.

## Status

Weekend hackathon project. Data loading and the UI shell work; replay
and calibration are in progress.
